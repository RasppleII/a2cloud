a2cloud (1.8.3) oldstable; urgency=low

  * First release from GitHub version

  [ Ivan Drucker ]
  * fix bug where language isn't properly selected for A2 login
  * download from Apple first, then Internet Archive as fallback

  [ Joseph Carter ]
  * Archived Ivan Drucker's A2CLOUD site in source tree
  * As this package will be native package, convert its changelog to Debian
    style.  Developers may want to install the devscripts package and have a
    look at the manpage for dch(1).  Mac developers, if you use TextExpander,
    I can share a snippet for RFC-2822 compliant dates.
  * Make adtpro.sh delay only happen when running interactively.
  * Begin using $PATH to find things so we can replace local binaries with
    packages later on.
  * Use unar package if it's available.
  * Use download.apple.com for Apple // files when possible, with archive.org
    as a fallback.
  * setup.txt is now 7-bit clean (the only reason it wasn't is the extended
    changelog at the bottom)

  [1.8.2]
  * download from Internet Archive
