# Ivan Drucker's A2CLOUD setup

A2CLOUD grew up alongside A2SERVER, yet it ends up being substantially
different in many ways.  Eseentially, it looks like Ivan wrote most of the
HTML for A2SERVER first, but had to rewrite the scripts a few times to be more
legible and robust.

A2CLOUD, by contrast, had a wordpress blog category turned into a user guide.
The HTML was more "proper" by modern standards (and HTML5-based rather than
HTML 3.2), but the scripts seem to be older and less refined.  This can be
likely attributed to A2SERVER requiring more debugging and therefore more
effort to flesh out quickly bodged scripts into readable, debuggable pieces.

There's less documentation here to archive than there is the original A2CLOUD
setup that began this repository, but having it helps inform some design
decisions.  So it's included here for completeness.
