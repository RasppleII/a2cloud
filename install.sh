Your system will be set up for a2cloud, providing you with
mass storage and online access for your Apple II!

If a2cloud is already installed, it will be upgraded to the
latest version.  It would sure be handy if we had an up to
date website to send you to for details.  You should harass
iKarith about that if you haven't recently.

A full installation could take quite awhile on very low-end
systems like the Raspberry Pi Zero.

Also, some actions will need to be performed as the root
(administrator) user.  We are assuming you have access to the
sudo command for that.
