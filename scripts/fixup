# To the extent possible under law, T. Joseph Carter and Ivan Drucker have
# waived all copyright and related or neighboring rights to the a2cloud
# scripts themselves.  Software used or installed by these scripts is subject
# to other licenses.  This work is published from the United States.

# The idea behind this script is to prevent other scripts from becoming a
# minefield of ancient and deprecated code designed to compensate for other
# even more ancient and replaced code that is no longer needed, no longer
# useful, and honestly complicates maintenance of that code.  Everything here
# will explain what it does, when it was put here, and it should remain clear
# when the legacy code may be removed.
#
# The use of functions which get immediately called is to try and prevent the
# long spidery conditional blocks a2cloud was originally known for.
